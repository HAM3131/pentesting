# FTP
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol for moving data across machines. This service is most often run on `port 21`

## Connect
```
$ ftp -p [IP ADDRESS]               -- the '-p' flag means the server opens a new port for the connection instead of the client doing so
```
This command will bring up prompts for a username and/or password to log into the ftp server.

## Commands
Once connected to the server, you can navigate the file structure with commands.
