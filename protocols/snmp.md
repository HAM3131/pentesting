# SNMP
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol for managing routers or devices. The protocol runs on `port 161` by default.

## Enumeration
SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device. The manufacturer default community strings of public and private are often unchanged. In version 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can acesss it. Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line that might be possible to reuse for other externally accessible services.

A tool like [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone) can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings.
