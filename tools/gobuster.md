# GoBuster
[GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) is a tool for uncovering hidden files or directories not intended for public access. It's a highly versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumerating public AWS S3 buckets. 

## Directory Brute Forcing
```
$ gobuster dir -u http://[IP ADDRESS]/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```
Different status codes we might get:
<center>

**Code** | **Description**
--- | ---
`200` | A successful request, meaning we can access this page.
`301` | Indicates a redirect to another page.
`403` | Indicates a that we are forbidden access.
</center>
If we get a page like `/wordpress` this is a commonly used CMS (content management system) and it has an enormous potential attack service. 

## DNS Subdomain Enumeration
To execute the following command, we need SecLists wordlists downloaded (apt install).
```
$ gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt
```
This will give us any subdomains found for the given domain.
