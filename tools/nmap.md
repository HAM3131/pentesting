# Nmap (Network Mapper)
This tool is used to enumerate a network.

## Scan Ports
```
$ nmap [IP ADDRESS]             --this will scan the 1000 most common ports (<1000) and only TCP by default
```
To get more information about the ports, we might use some flags:
```
 -sC        -- scan type - default scripts. This will run default scripts to identify services and vulnerabilities
 -sV        -- scan type - version. This will determine what version of services are being run
 -p-        -- all ports. This will scan all the way to port 65,535
```
